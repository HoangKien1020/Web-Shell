We can make reverse shell via cmd of `shell.php` or upload direct `revershell.php`.

Two ways:
1. reverse shell via cmd of `shell.php`. I will make python3 code to generate reverse shell via cmd for all languages and os.
2. `revershell.php`: change your IP and Port and your IP with ex:  `nc -lvp 1234`- this works for Linux OS
